Welcome to Savanna, our application that allows you, the user,
to become more eco-friendly by setting environmentally green goals.

Here's how Savanna works:

1. Launch the app and create a goal, with a custom description.
If you can't think of any ideas, you can press a button for the app to
suggest a goal for you.
2. You can set reminders for any environmental goal that you have by
right-clicking it and selecting "Edit Reminders". Both weekly and daily
reminders, which are sent through our Discord bot, are available.
3. At any point in time, you may customise your goals by selecting "Edit
Goal", or delete the goal by selecting "Delete".
4. Once you have completed your goal, select "Complete" after
right-clicking.
5. After you have finished a certain number of goals, you can go to
the "Unlock" window to unlock various minigames, playable on the
Discord bot.
